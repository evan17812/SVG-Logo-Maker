# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This project is to create a logo for projects using the terminal. It will ask a series of questions to generate the shape, color, text color, and Logo characters to Generate the ideal Logo. The goal is to cut out the middle man, looking for a graphic designer, and save the money creating logos for each project. Ultimately, this project has the capabilites to create the iodeal logo you have in mind. This application does require inquirer and jest to opearate so they must be installed first. The logo generated will be automatically generated and saved as a svg file once all the questions have been answered.
